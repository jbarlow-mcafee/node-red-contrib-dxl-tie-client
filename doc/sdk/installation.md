  more information.

* Command Line Installation

  With this approach, the TIE DXL Node-RED client package is installed via
  [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) from the command-line on the host where the
  Node-RED server is running. See the
  [Command Line Installation](#command-line-installation) section below for more
  information.

#### Node-RED Based Installation

1. Browse to your Node-RED server.

1. In the upper-right corner, press the side menu button.

1. Choose the `Manage palette` option in the menu drop-down list.

1. From the `Palette` user settings tab, click on the `Install` tab.

#### Command Line Installation

Before installing the TIE DXL Node-RED client package, first navigate in a
command shell to the user directory which you have configured for Node-RED. The
`.node-red` directory under the user's `HOME` directory is the default user
directory for Node-RED.

For Mac and Linux-based operating systems, run the following command:

```sh
cd ~/.node-red
```

For Windows, run the following command:

```sh
cd %HOMEPATH%\.node-red
```

To install the library from a local tarball for a Mac or Linux-based operating
system, run the following command:

```sh
npm install ./lib/{@releasetarballname} --save
```

To install the library from a local tarball for Windows, run:

```sh
npm install .\lib\{@releasetarballname} --save
```

To install the library via the
[npm package registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opendxl/node-red-contrib-dxl-tie-client),
run the following command:

```sh
npm install @opendxl/node-red-contrib-dxl-tie-client --save
```

After the installation is complete, restart Node-RED and browse to your
Node-RED server.

#### Confirming the Installation Result
